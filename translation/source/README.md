# IMPORTANT

Translations are managed with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/lichess).

In this folder, the only source file that we can edit is `mobile.xml`.

The other files are sources from
[lila](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/tree/master/translation/source) that
are automatically fetched from Crowdin. They should **NOT** be edited, as they
will be overwritten.
